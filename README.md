# Supervised Learning Projects

This repository contains two complete supervised learning workflows using real-world datasets from Kaggle:

- 🔍 **Classification Task**: Predicting survival on the Titanic dataset.
- 🏠 **Regression Task**: Predicting house prices using the Housing dataset.

Both projects include:
- Data Loading
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Preprocessing
- Model Building with multiple algorithms
- Cross-Validation
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Final Evaluation
